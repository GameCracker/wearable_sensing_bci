The Dry Sensor Interface API dynamic libraries in this directory have version 1.15.0.

To create a DSI application:

(1) Add the file DSI_API_Loader.c to your project (can be compiled as C or C++)

(2) #include "DSI.h" in your own C or C++ code

(3) Call Load_DSI_API() in your code before calling any of the other functions.

(4) Check the return value of Load_DSI_API before proceeding. It will be zero on
    success. Any non-zero value means the API failed to load and other API calls
    (function names starting with DSI_) should not be called.
    
Consult demo.c for more details, including commented example code.
